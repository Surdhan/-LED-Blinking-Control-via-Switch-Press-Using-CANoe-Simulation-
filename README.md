# -LED-Blinking-Control-via-Switch-Press-Using-CANoe-Simulation-
Implement LED blinking control via switch press using CANoe. Simulate switch input and LED output. Use CAPL scripting to toggle LED based on switch activation. Configure CANoe, write CAPL code for LED logic, and test for accurate response and timing consistency in various switch scenarios.
